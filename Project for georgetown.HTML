  <header><strong><font size="6">Why We Chose Our Topic?</font></strong><br><br>
    <font size="4"; style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">We chose the topic of video games because all 5 of us play them and it was one of the more interesting topics to us out of the options we could have chosen. The question we proposed and decided to research was “What makes a video game successful?”.
      The game that motivated us to pick that question was the rapid, and recent success of the game Fortnite. I’m sure you all have heard of that. Other reasons for picking the topic is because the industry is constantly burgeoning. In the recent past
      the industry is starting to reach heights that were never thought to be tangible. The market is constantly growing with new players buying games everyday and joining the community. The industry provides you an opportunity to show your creative and
      analytical skills. The game designers are responsible for conceptualizing the theme, rules of the video game, and the structure of the game. Being analytical and organized are skills that you absolutely need. The video game industry is also a significant
      contributor the the global entertainment economy. Compared to other, more established industries such as music and television it has a unique value of being available on multiple devices such as mobile, console, pc, etc. Today more americans on
      average play video games than go to the movies. We think that industry if not already considered the most popular type of entertainment it will be soon.

  <header><strong><font size="6">Our Findings:</font></strong></header><br>
  <Font size="4"; style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
    <div align="left">
    <li>We found our data on GitHub recording many different statistics from the largest game vendor on PC, Steam.</li>
      <li>Steam is an application you can download to purchase games.</li>
      <li>There were many different categories that described each video game.</li>
      <li>Some examples of categories we used were total players, rating of the game, release date, and the in app purchases of the game.</li>
      <li>We had to remove some data randomly because R could not handle a data set containing 13000 games with more than 20 columns of data</li>
      <li>Esports is where professional gamers who are highly skilled in video games and play competitively for cash prizes.</li>
      <li>Originally our group started our project by gathering several data points about some of the most popular games of all time</li>
      <li>The first issue with this was the size of our data, due to the small amount of sources and categories the set was not nearly large enough</li>
      <li>Furthermore, the next complication we had was that we were not including games that were inferior and very poor therefore we were not including a control group or reasons why a game was not good in order to provide contrast and reach the most logical conclusion</li>
      <li>Due to these negative factors our group sought out another source of information and we found a spreadsheet with a substantially larger amount of data which attributed astronomically to our success</li>

<p><li>Between total players and price there is a negative correlation, which means as the price of a game increases in general the amount of player lessens. This is an obvious relationship since people won’t want to purchase an outrageously expensive game. Finding the right price balance to appease the player base and make a profit is a struggle video game companies have to battle to be successful.</li></p>


<img src="http://127.0.0.1:8887/graph2.png" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;">
<p><li>The relationship between rating and total players has a strong a strong positive correlation. This can be seen since almost no games rated on Steam between 0-80 have a large player base compared to games that are rated,which see an 80+ see a large increase in player base. On Steam this shows that potential success heavily relies on community opinion, which means companies should prioritize making their rating high.</li></p>


<img src="http://127.0.0.1:8887/graph3.png" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;">
<p><li>The ability to play with friends is a key to success for a video game. Per our data we found that the games that offer multiplayer modes almost always perform better than single player games. This shows how video gamers value connection to other players while playing games.

<p><li>In-app purchases don’t play a huge role in a games rating and overall success. This can be seen since both games that do provide in-app purchases and that don’t are both rated very highly.</li></p>

  <br><br>
  <Font size="4"; style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">
<font size="4; style=font-faimly: Comic Sans MS"><p>As a result of the data we found and analyzed we concluded that there is not one quantitative element that makes a video game successful, it is a combination of multiple elements. Some of the components of a successful video game are no to little cost, the low price of the game is offset by the player bases willingness to buy in-app purchases. The ability to play with friends and having a good rating by current players to persuade more potential players to play also play an important role in measuring the success of a videogame. Although these are some of the most crucial aspects for a video game to include, there are still some qualitative factors of a potential video game that can make it successful, but these types of factors cannot be put into a proper data set. So things like how interesting a games main story line is or the individual difficulty of each game cannot be quantified properly in data.   </p>
